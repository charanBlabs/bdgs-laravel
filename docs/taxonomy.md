## 1. Brand & Visual Foundation (Locked)

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Primary color | `#E74D56` (coral-red) |
| Secondary color | `#95256E` (deep purple) |
| Dark base | `#1A1A2E` |

| Favicon URL | `https://ik.imagekit.io/h1pfsvzlsf/bdgrowthsuite/images/favicon.png` |

## 2. Brand Voice & Positioning

- **Identity:** AI-Assisted + Brilliant Directories Expert. Not a pure dev agency. Not a pure SaaS. The intersection.
- **Tagline anchor:** "The only directory team that gets you from 0→1→10→100…$1M"
- **Naming preference:** Use "Brilliant Directories" or "Directory" / "Directory site" in copy. Avoid "BD" abbreviation in customer-facing copy (acceptable in internal docs and meta tags).
- **Voice:** Founder-led, anti-fluff, concrete, oppositional ("not a ticket queue", "not a slideshow"), startup-savvy.
- **Mantra:** *"If something doesn't work for you — that's our responsibility to fix. Adding value is our job. The final call is always yours."*

## 3. Trust & Proof Anchors

- 🏅 Gold Certified Brilliant Directories Partner
- 🤖 Claude / Anthropic Service Partner
- 🌍 500+ Directory Sites · 7+ Countries
- 169+ Verified Reviews (Brilliant Directories marketplace)
- 10+ Years in Directory Ecosystem

- BD CEO endorsement across 3 official webinars

```

Thin strip (~32-36px), light gray background, smaller font (12-13px). Contains brand credibility on left + utility links on right.

### Main Navigation

```

```

- **Logo:** Clickable to home. No `/home` link in nav.

## 11. SEO & Discovery Pattern (Hub-Spoke)

The site uses a **hub-and-spoke architecture** for SEO and navigation:

- **Hub pages** (e.g., `/solutions/seo`) contain minimal intro copy and link to individual spoke pages
- **Spoke pages** (e.g., `/solutions/schema-for-homepage`) are full SEO-optimized detail pages
- Each hub cross-links to related hubs (e.g., `/solutions/seo` links to `/solutions/page-design`)
- Visitor never hits a dead end

This pattern applies to:
- `/solutions/*` (8 hubs → 61 spokes)
- `/grow-with-ai` (hub → 5 sub-pages)
- `/themes` (hub → 6 theme pages)
- `/partners` (hub → 3 tier pages)

---

## 12. LLM Visibility Strategy (Existing)

Already live:
- `/llms.txt` — LLM index
- `/llms-full.txt` — comprehensive single-file content

Strategy: Every page should be:
1. SEO-optimized for human search (Google)
2. Crawlable and authoritative for LLM training (CommonCrawl)
3. Useful as RAG context (live retrieval by Claude/ChatGPT/Cursor)

Existing 24 blog posts + 61 solutions + planned content all serve dual purpose: human conversion + LLM positioning.

---

## 14. Items Parked for Later Discussion

These decisions are noted and will be revisited:

1. **Whether Custom Projects gets its own card in the Services Stacking section on homepage** — currently only listed in Services dropdown
2. **Inline project intake form fields and structure for `/customization` page**
3. **Final pricing for Dedicated BD Developer and AI Dev Fleet tiers** (currently `$X,XXX/mo` placeholders)
4. **Stacking cards CSS technical issue** — to be solved with Yakin's developer when in-person
5. **Final structure for `/grow-with-ai` hub page** — how the 4 modes of AI (build for you / build by you / automate / SEO) lay out visually
